BPLATE-WPI 1.0
================
BPLATE_WPI is a WordPress install script forked from WP Quick Install to work within the BPLATE-WP project. It is a PHP script which automatically downloads and installs WordPress plugins and themes using form input or as per a configuration file.

Instead of installing all of WordPress, it automates only the wp-config, plugins, and themes portion of the script.
